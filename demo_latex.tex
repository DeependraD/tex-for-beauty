\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}

This is the first line of text that has been typesetted by latex. This is the simplest of all too. Next I will elaborate how to best create tex files that will render beautifully formatted text.

I didn't placed a title line or a header formatted line because I'm still looking for the ways to do that. BTW, I don't blame myself for cheating when I rendered some documents previously with templates from really awesome peoples. That's how the world progresses, one goes further building upon the foundations laid by the other.
